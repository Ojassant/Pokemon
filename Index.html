            Pokémon (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters[b] in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".[5][6] There are currently 901 Pokémon species.[7]

            The franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. It soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media.[8] Pokémon has since become the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The video game series is the fourth best-selling video game franchise with more than 380 million copies sold[9] and one billion mobile downloads,[10] and it spawned an anime television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation[11] with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 183 countries.[9] In addition, the Pokémon franchise includes the world's top-selling toy brand,[12] the top-selling trading card game[13] with over 34.1 billion cards sold,[9] an anime film series, a live-action film (Detective Pikachu), books, manga comics, music, merchandise, and a temporary theme park. The franchise is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series, where various Pokémon characters are playable.

            In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement.

            Ash Ketchum is the main protagonist of the Pokémon Anime series. He is a 10-year-old Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town in the Kanto region that has always dreamed of becoming the world's greatest Pokémon Master. The first human character to be introduced in the series, he is the winner of the Orange League and Kanto Battle Frontier and also the Alola region's Pokémon Champion, receiving the title after winning its first Pokémon League Conference.

            On his 10th birthday, he realized he overslept. Ash rushed to Professor Oak's Laboratory to get his first Pokémon. Originally wanting to choose Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charmander, but he ended up receiving the Pokémon Pikachu instead, as he arrived late (thus leaving him with no other Starters to choose from even though this was his birthday). At first, Pikachu did not obey Ash and kept running away, so Ash had to tie him up. After getting chased by a flock of Spearow later in the day thanks to Ash's recklessness, Ash attempted to save Pikachu from them. Seeing that Ash was so determined to help him, Pikachu protected Ash from the Spearow by electrocuting the entire flock (which was thanks to being struck by lightning at that exact moment and having his Electric-type move supercharged). From then on, Pikachu and Ash became best friends. As an unskilled Trainer, Ash traveled with Misty and Brock throughout the Kanto region, capturing new Pokémon along the way.

        <p>Pikachu[c] is a species of Pokémon, fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of media of the Pokémon franchise by The Pokémon Company. Pikachu is a yellow mouse-like Pokémon with powerful electrical abilities. Pikachu is the best-known species of Pokémon, largely due to its appearance in the anime series as the starter Pokémon of the protagonist, Ash Ketchum. Pikachu is a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years, as well as one of the major mascots for Nintendo.

            Pikachu's design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori.[1] Pikachu first appeared in Pokémon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pokémon video games, Pokémon Red and Blue, for the Game Boy.
            
            In most vocalized appearances, including the anime and certain video games, it is primarily voiced by Ikue Ōtani. Pikachu also appeared in the primary cast of the live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu, performed in CGI and voiced by Ryan Reynolds, as well as in every installment of the Super Smash Bros. series, including Katy Perry's music video Electric.</p>
